# PneumoNet: Chest X-ray Classification for Pneumonia Detection

#  Overview

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model, named PneumoNet, is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is trained on Google Colab, leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient computation. The dataset consists of labeled chest X-ray images of both pneumonia-affected and normal cases.

# Purpose

Pneumonia is a severe lung infection that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project aims to provide an AI-driven solution to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia accurately and efficiently, reducing dependency on manual radiological assessments.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes chest X-ray images labeled as Normal or Pneumonia. These images were preprocessed to enhance contrast and remove noise, improving the model's learning capability.

# How the Model Works

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Extracts key patterns from chest X-ray images.

ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity, helping the model learn complex features.

Pooling Layers: Reduce image dimensions while retaining important information.

Fully Connected Layers: Perform final classification into Normal or Pneumonia categories.

Softmax Activation: Outputs probabilities for each class, aiding in accurate predictions.

#  How the Model was Trained

Data Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalization, and augmentation (flipping, rotation, zooming).

Model Selection: Trained a custom CNN and also experimented with pre-trained models like ResNet and VGG.

Training Process:

Used Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.

Categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.

Trained for multiple epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Validation: Evaluated using accuracy, loss, confusion matrices, and Grad-CAM heatmaps.
